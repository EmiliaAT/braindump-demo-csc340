## Project Statement

BrainDump is a platform for creating, publishing, and sharing
knowledge in the form of written articles.

Users can create articles for either personal use, or to be shared
publically. Public articles can be searched for by other users and
replied to. Users can like and bookmark articles, and follow authors
they like. Authors of public articles can also create series, allowing
for continuous updates on certain topics for others to subscribe to.

BrainDump aims to be lightweight and suited to users needs. This is
why all articles are written in simple Markdown, with optional version
control. In order to suit all user needs, articles can be either
private or public. Users are able to write on the go, and download
articles for offline use.

## Functionality

1.  **Customer \[Reader\]**:

    a. Create/modify/remove customer profile:

        Customers (base users) can create a new profile and
        delete / modify a pre-existing profile (such as
        by changing user settings - theme, icon, etc.)

    b. View available services:

        Customers can view posted articles from a home page. Articles
        can be filtered by tags and topics, as well as sorted by metrics
        such as popularity and approval.

    c. Subscribe to available services:

        Customers can subscribe to authors to get notified of when
        followed authors upload or update articles. This can be viewed
        from the home page, or a dedicated dashboard.

    d. Write reviews for subscribed services:

        Customers can leave comments on articles to discuss the source
        material. Customers can also rate articles, which appears as
        a public statistic on the article and is used for popularity
        sorting.

2.  **Provider \[Author\]**:

    a. Create/modify/remove provider profile:

        Providers (authors) can create a new profile with author
        settings and delete / modify a pre-existing profile (such as
        by changing user settings - theme, icon, etc.)

    b. Create services:

        Providers can create and publish articles or article
        collections for other users to see. Articles are simply
        Markdown, with optional[?] version control where applicable.

    c. View customer statistics:

        Providers can view how many times their articles have been
        viewed, shared, and liked/favourited from a dedicated
        statistics page.

    d. Reply to reviews:

        Providers can leave replies to comments left by other users,
        and their replies / comments will be annotated with an
        "Author" tag to verify their identity as the original creator.
